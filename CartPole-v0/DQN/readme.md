#  DQN (Deep Q-Network)

It is value based method which uses Deep Neural Network as Value function Approximator with Experience Replay. It uses a target network which is updated once in a few steps. The state-action pairs are sampled from batch-memory and the batch memory is renewed at fixed intervals.

Here I have implemented the following algorithms

- [x] DQN (High State)
- [x] DQN (Low state)
